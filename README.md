This is a Reshuffle template app which demonstrates basic usage of Reshuffle Identity. To learn more about Reshuffle Identity, [check out the docs](dev.reshuffle.app/identity).

> Note: Reshuffle is built on top of Create React App

## Getting Started

1. `npm start` to run a local version of your app.
2. Make changes, and see them reflected locally.
  > Note: Your frontend code resides in the standard `src` directory.
          Backend code needs to reside in the `backend` directory. [Read more here](dev.reshuffle.app)
3. `npx reshuffle deploy` to deploy your app to the cloud.

## Available Scripts

In the directory of your Reshuffle project, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
You will see any backend errors on the command line

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Read more about deploying with Reshuffle [here](https://dev.reshuffle.app/deploying-to-reshuffle)

### `npx reshuffle deploy`

Deploys your Reshuffle app to the cloud, thereby making it available on your apps URL.

> Note: `reshuffle deploy` implicitly runs `npm run build`

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
